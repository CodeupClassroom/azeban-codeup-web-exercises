    //Window object < has a lot of neat properties, nested objects, methods

    //window.location = "differentWebsite"
    //window.location.reload() (a method to reload)
    //window.history.back() || window.history.forward()
    //Dozens and DOZENS of properties. . here's a couple specific ones we want to practice with

    //setInterval()
    //Maybe like. .  do this thing every X seconds

    //You will need - the number of seconds between executin
    //And a thing to execute?
    //We often want to start with a variable

    //setInterval(function(){ //stuff to do }, numMs)

    // let num = setInterval(function(){
    //     console.log("Hey - it's time for me to say hello. I say hello every 5 seconds")
    // }, 5000)
    //
    // let num2 = setInterval(function(){
    //     console.log("Hey - it is time for me to say what's up. I say what's up every 2.5 seconds")
    // }, 2500)

    //What if I want to stop this tho? In a loop I would break. . setInterval will RETURN a "id" for this process

    //We used clearInterval in the console with both variables of num && num2

    //setTimeout()
    //Maybe like. . "Hey, do you still wanna be logged in?"

    let seeTimeout = confirm("Do you want to see the example of the timeout message?")


    let timeoutId = setTimeout(function(){

        let stayLogged = confirm("Do you want to stay logged in?");

    }, 7000)

    if(!seeTimeout){
        clearTimeout(timeoutId);
    }

    //? What are the differences between the two?
